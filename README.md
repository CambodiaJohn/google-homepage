This is a project from TOP (The Oden Project).

The purpose of this project is to make a copy of the Google homepage.


What I have learned / practiced. 
1. Practiced using common Terminal commands such as cd, rm, ls, touch, mkdir, 

2. Practiced using git work flow commands such as git status, git clone, git add, git commit -m "", git log, git push origin main.

3. Practiced basic HTML and CSS. Most memorial is learning to give elements an "id" then using the "id" to style the element. 
And how to use unordered lists. 

4. Practiced using google to find answers to my questions. (it helps to know the words to search for)


Notes: I was not trying to copy style exactly I feel that would have been wasting time frivolously. The goal was to learn how to structure a basic index.html .

Questions I have: Is spacing by % or px better? or is a combination ok? Before looking it up I guess % because a 50px boarder on an 8k screen would probably look half the size as a 4k screen. 
Also does this text editor have spell check?
